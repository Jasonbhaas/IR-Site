		  				<p>Specializing in utilizing exiting facilities which often have obsolescent features and through modifications modernizing them to fit today's manufacturing, logistic and general industrial needs.  This may involve demolishing parts of facilities, modifying loading, yard areas, utility upgrades among other retrofits.  The end result is the ability to use existing assets avoiding costly demolition and new development which can offer a cost advantage.  This enables the projects to lease or sale much quicker and allows today's industrial users to be more competitive by lowering their costs.</p>

It will clean up and environmental condition that many developers, lenders and users will not touch until the site is clean and no public health risk is present.  It puts back into use an existing facility decreasing unnecessary green field development.  Finally, it can offer the end  user a cost advantage occupying a redeveloped site.  The remediation of the site often involves a multi-level approach which will include extraction, vapor barriers, administrative controls among other tools.</p>

						<h2>Intel, DuPont California</h2>
						
						<p>Industrial Redevelopment with partner Fortress Investments acquired the former Intel campus in DuPont Washington.  The project includes two 320,000 square foot four story state of the art office buildings and a 370,000 square foot warehouse manufacturing facility.  Bruce negotiated a partial lease back of some critical space in the complex with Intel Corp as part of the purchase and is currently redeveloping the remaining space on the campus.

							<h2>Banning</h2>
							
							<p>A property located in Banning, CA totaling 125,000 square feet.  The property was originally a manufacturing facility which produced connectors for the aerospace industry.  As with many older manufacturing facilities it had some functional obsolesces and an environmental condition.   IR purchase the property on an all cash basis and invested significant dollars getting a clean phase 1, and renovating the facilities.  The property is now fully leased creating jobs for the city, repurposing an old facility and creating cash flow for Industrial Redevelopment.  This is an example of adaptive reuse and brownfield redevelopment.

							<h2>Richmond Steel Manufacturing Facility</h2>
						
						<p>Bruce has teamed up with LDK associates to redevelop the former Steelscape facility in Richmond California.  What started as a potential redevelopment for a previous client turned into to complete demo and rebuild due to environmental conditions.  The site is a total of 42 acres located off I-80 in Richmond, CA.  The purchase price included a hold back for demo and environmental.  The project is now in the final stages of the clean-up work and IR with LDK will develop an approximate 700,000 sq.ft. state of the art distribution facility.  This site had sat empty for over 6 years until being taken on as a brownfield redevelopment project, going from an eyesore to bringing in new industry, jobs and eliminating an environmental condition.
